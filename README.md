**Final project - Cyclistic bike-share analysis**

**Scenario**

* Cyclistic: A bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600
docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand
tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities
and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for
traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more
likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use the bikes to commute to work each day.
* Lily Moreno: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for
the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
These may include email, social media, and other channels.
* Cyclistic marketing analytics team: A team of data analysts who are responsible for
collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
You joined this team six months ago and have been busy learning about Cyclistic’s
mission and business goals—as well as how you, as a junior data analyst, can help
Cyclistic achieve them.
* Cyclistic executive team: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide
whether to approve the recommended marketing program.

**Question to answer: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?**
